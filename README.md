## Profile

I design and build production-oriented data pipelines.

I turn raw, unreliable data into clean, queryable datasets using Python, SQL, and cloud-style architecture. My background in engineering and project leadership taught me how to ship systems that work under pressure and scale with demand.

Current focus:
- AutomatingETL pipelines
- Cloud data engineering on AWS
- Analytics-ready modelling
- Building engineering-grade projects

## Core Capabilities

### Data Engineering
- Ingestion from APIs and files
- ETL pipelines with Python
- Schema design (3NF, analytics modelling)
- Validation, logging, reproducibility

### Cloud & Automation
- AWS patterns (S3 ingestion, Lambda-style jobs)
- Dockerised pipelines
- Event-driven processing
- CI-style workflows

### Databases & SQL
- PostgreSQL, MySQL
- Indexing and optimisation
- Data integrity modelling

### BI & Monitoring
- Power BI
- Grafana
- SQL-first analytics

Also working with:
SQL | AWS | dbt | Airflow | Power BI | Data Modelling | Snowflake

## Flagship Projects

### **[ETL Platform](https://github.com/Eng-ADAL/Obscured-by-Clouds) | Local & Cloud** (In Progress)
**Production-style data pipeline simulating cloud ingestion and transformation**

Features:
- Event-based ingestion
- Data validation
- Structured output layers
- Dockerised runtime
- Extensible pipeline design

### **[Tracker](https://github.com/Eng-ADAL/Tracker)**
**Python-based structured data capture system**

Turning chaotic copy-paste workflows into clean, usable datasets.

### **[Café CLI](https://github.com/Eng-ADAL/CoffeeShop_Manager)**
**Transactional application → analytics-ready ETL pipeline**

- CSV ingestion
- 3NF schema conversion
- SQL queries
- Unit tests
- Documentation

## Professional Background

Engineering Project Lead turned Data Engineer.

Previously led design and delivery of B2B machinery systems. Owned production pipelines, supplier flow, engineering design and stakeholder communication. I now apply the same operational discipline to data systems.

## What I am building next

- Cloud-first ingestion pipeline on AWS (S3, Lambda-style jobs)
- Event-driven ETL framework with Python
- Query layer using Athena
- Data modelling for analytics-ready tables with Redshift and Snowflake (json style)
- Live dashboards (Grafana / Power BI)
- Personal Linux-based remote engineering environment (SSH, tmux, Docker, Python, SQL)

## Open To Roles

Junior Data Engineer  
Cloud Engineer (entry)  
Analytics Engineer  

I build things and I document them properly.
